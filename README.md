# 03 JavaScript: Scramble-Password 
   Description: This script was written to be able to create a password generator with random characters including upper case and lower case letters, numbers, and special characters. An array of variables was created for each of these characters. A function was created that allowed the user to choose the lenght of their password. If the password was not bewteen 8-128 characters it will prompt them to pcik a different number. A confim was present to allow the user to pick between OK(true) or Cancel(false) which then determined if that specific character was to be chosen. If the user picked all cancel an alert will appear to choose at least one character.
